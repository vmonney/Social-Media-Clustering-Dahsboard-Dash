# Social Media Clustering Dashboard

## Overview
The Social Media Clustering Dashboard is a Python-based project that aims to analyze and visualize social media data to identify clusters of similar performing posts. This project is particularly useful for understanding patterns and trends in social media engagement.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Utilizes Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and hypothesis testing.
- **Clustering Algorithm**: Implements a K-Means clustering algorithm to group similar social media posts.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Offers a Dash-based web application for interactive visualization of clustering results.

## Installation
To set up the project, you need to install the required Python packages. You can do this by running:
```bash
pip install pandas plotly dash jupyter scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. **Data Analysis**: Start by exploring the `Clustering.ipynb` notebook. This notebook walks you through the process of loading data, preprocessing, and applying the clustering algorithm.
2. **Running the Dashboard**: Execute `dashboard.py` to launch the Dash web application. This will start a local server where you can interact with the visualizations.
